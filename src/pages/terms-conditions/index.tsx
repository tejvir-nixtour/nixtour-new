                                        The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to the terms & conditions of the concerned airline, including but not limited to cancellation and refund policies.
                                        <br />
                                        Nixtour merely acts as a facilitator to enable the User to book a flight ticket. The contract of service for utilization of the flight is always between the User and the concerned airline.
                                        <br />
                                        Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, route, change or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without prior intimation to Nixtour. As a facilitator Nixtour has no control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.
                                        <br />
                                        Different tickets on the same airline may carry different restrictions or include different services and price.
                                        <br />
                                        The baggage allowance on given fare is as per the terms decided by the airline, and Nixtour has no role to play in the same. Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are "hand baggage fares" which do not entitle the User for free check in baggage and therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check in baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the airlines for detailed costs.

                                        Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with other Airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners with another airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as "operated by" in the booking flow.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior to payment.</p>

                                        In case the User is carrying any valuable personal belongings, it is advisable not to leave them behind at the time of disembarking or leaving the coach. Nixtour will not be held responsible or liable in case of loss of such items from the coach. All baggage and personal effects are at all times and in all circumstances the responsibility of the User.
                                        <br />
                                        Any damage caused to the coach during travel as a consequence of the actions of the User shall be payable by the User and Nixtour would in no manner whatsoever be liable for the same.

                                        Tipping is customary (unless otherwise stated in the brochure) in all parts of the world for services rendered (e.g. porters, coach drivers, guides etc.). This is however solely at the discretion of the User.
                                        <br />
                                        Tipping in Europe is something that is expected of anyone providing you a service, for example, local guides, waiters, tour manager, porter etc. However, it is mandatory to tip the coach driver a nominal amount of 2 Euros for Europe and UK and 2 Dollars for USA per person per day for the duration of the tour.

                                        It is recommended that the User carries money partly in local currency (i.e. in the currency of the country where he/she is traveling), partly in traveler's cheques or travel currency card. Traveler's cheque is a safe way to carry money as they are easily cashable for a small service fee charged by the bank and can be replaced if they are stolen or lost, provided you have the traveler's cheque numbers and the counterfoil.

                                        Alternatively, the User can carry a travel currency card, which is by far the safest way to carry foreign currency and provides 24*7 access to cash at relevant ATMs.
