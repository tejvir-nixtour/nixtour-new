                                    <p>When offering insurance, Nixtour may have to use and share personal data that is relevant to the insurance product. This data relates to you as a potential or actual policyholder, the beneficiaries under a policy, family members, claimants and other parties involved in a claim:</p>

                                            To provide offers, arrange insurance cover and handle insurance claims, some personal data, provided to us during the booking process, (‘General Order Data’) may have to be shared with Nixtour. You may also be asked to provide additional information, such as names of family members or other beneficiaries or details about a claim (‘Insurance-Specific Data’).
                                        </li>
                                        <li className='text-sm font-semibold'>
                                            If you make a claim under an insurance policy, this claim may be directly handled by the insurer. This means that you may be asked to provide personal data to submit the claim directly to them. The insurer will inform you accordingly at the point of collection of your information. When your claim is handled by the insurer, Nixtour may receive information about the status of your claim to provide you with customer support services.

                                    <p><strong>How does Nixtour process communications that you and your booked agency may send via Nixtour?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Nixtour can offer you and booking agencies several ways to communicate about the trip/stay Services and existing booking arrangements, directing the communications via Nixtour.

                                    <p>At Nixtour, we use social media in separate ways. We use it to facilitate the use of online reservation services, but also to promote our booking agencies’ travel-related products and services and to advertise, improve and facilitate our own services.</p>
                                    <p>Note that the use of social media features can result in the exchange of personal data between Nixtour and the social media service provider, as we describe below. You are free not to use any of the social media features available to you.
                                    </p>

We do this to reduce the need for you to remember different usernames and passwords for different online services. After you’ve signed in once, you’ll be able to use your social media account to sign into your Nixtour account. You can decouple your Nixtour user account from your chosen social media account any time you want to.

This means that when you click or tap on one of the buttons (such as Facebook’s ‘Like’ button), certain information is shared with these social media providers. If you’re logged into your social media account when you click or tap one of these buttons, your social media provider may relate this information to your social media account. Depending on your settings, they might also display these actions on your social media profile, to be seen by others in your network.

                                            Other social media services and features. We may integrate other social media services (like social media messaging) for you to interact with Nixtour or with your contacts about our services. We may maintain social media accounts and offer apps on several social media sites. Whenever you connect with Nixtour through social media, your social media service provider may allow you to share information with us.

                                    <p>If you choose to share, your social media provider will inform you about which information will be shared. For example, when you sign into a Nixtour user account using your social media account, certain information from that account may be shared with Nixtour. This includes your email address, your age, and the profile pictures you’ve saved – depending on what you authorise in your social media account.

                                        <br />
                                        We’ll use this information to help provide you with the service you requested – for example, to forward a message you want to send to your contacts, or to create a personalised user experience in the app or on our websites. It means that if you want us to, we can tailor our services to suit your needs, connecting you and your friends with the best travel destinations and analysing and improving our travel-related services.
                                        <br />
                                        Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data when you connect to Nixtour through them. This can include combining the personal data they collect when you use Nixtour through them with information they collect when you use other online platforms you have also linked to your social media account.
                                        <br />

All personal data we keep about you as a Nixtour customer is covered by this Privacy Statement.

                                    For added protection, we strongly recommend that you set up two-factor authentication for your Nixtour user account. This adds an extra authentication step, to make sure that anyone who gets hold of your username and password (e.g., through phishing or social engineering) won’t be able to get into your account. You can set this up in the Security section of your account settings.

The limited circumstances we might need to collect the personal data of children under 16 years old include: as part of a reservation, the purchase of other travel-related services, or in other exceptional circumstances (such as features addressed to families). Again, this will only be used and collected as provided by a parent or guardian and with their consent.
